# Welcome to My Infrastructure Lab Repo
The source of information for all things related to my Home Lab. To see what I am currently workintg on vist:
[my roadmap](./roadmap.md).

## Why make this repo?
I wanted a versioned source of truth for my configurations and experiments that I could share across devices. I am also hoping that my progress
and lessons learned may serve as a baseline/learning tool for others. The goal is to use this repo to practice documentation discipline, infrastructure design, and automation.

## What is in this repo?
The main split of the repo will be into 3 sections:
- /docs (**Under Construction**) <br> 
  This is where I store all of my documentation for my lab (except for passwords). Any projects developed in conjunction with lab work
  will be referenced as such.

- /logs (**Under Construction**)<br>
  This is where I will write daily updates, track changes, and seperate those into larger blog posts.
  
- /automation (**Under Construction**) <br>
  This is a home for all of the scripts that shouldn't/are waiting to be split into seperate projects.
  
## Disclaimer
I will try to make sure to license this repository appropriately when I get to that point, but for right now: Any code, documentation, graphic, 
or other media contained in this repository is free and open (License Pending). This repository is seen as a log of my own personal
learning journey, and as such, I want the information contained within to be available to everyone.A
