# Lab Journal 2026-02-02

I've basically decided to start writing these as I go, flow of conciousness
style.

So first up on the roadmap/to-do list is:

## Design Naming Scheme
Since I've already purchased a domain (xander-lab.it.com) I can use that for my local DNS/FQDN's. So the main thing is: what do I want to name devices.

I think a good idea is to go ahead and have some sort of location/function code, and then a device usage code, and then a number, so a basic layout 
would be:

    LLL+UUU+NNN, LLL = Location code, UUU = Usage/Device code, NNN = Number
    
So the current layout would be:
    
    Router = labrou001
    Core Switch = labl3s001
    Access Switch 1 = labswi001
    Access Switch 2 = labswi002
    VM Host = labvmh001
    
VM's would be virdns001, virdom001, virweb004, etc. Let's see if ChatGPT can poke holes in this.

ChatGPT gave the pass for now. Worried about future proofing, but I would judge it as a success if this lasts long enough for that to happen.
I will set out some exact device codes as I go in the documentation, with provision for the obvious ones that I need or will need now/ in the
immediate future.

Next is:

## Design Managment Address and VLAN scheme:

I'm going to start with the IP Address layout, mainly because reserved private address ranges are doing *alot* of work here, so it pays to be 
eplicit:

    172.16.0.0 - 172.16.255.255 = Management IP Range. (Likely to start as a /24, but I want alot of room between future cloud and VM's)
    172.24.0.0 - 172.24.255.255 = Administrative IP Range. 
    10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255 = Network IP Range

For some clarification, when I say management IP Range, I mean actual management network for network devices to be constantly reachable.
The Administrative IP Range is for servers and virtual hosts that aren't necessarily "Oh Shit" levels of necessary, but I wuold still like a 
backdoor in case of outage. The rest will be assigned per usage, probably first third for core, second third for access, and third for lab scenarios.
There are entirely to many IP's in these ranges for me to ever need to worry, but the hard seperation helps mentally.

ChatGPT check inbound (For those reading this, I know AI can rot the brain, but I am solo here, so pushback helps. I will plant trees in the future
for my sins).

Gippity was mad, so I'll clarify FTFM: Management in this context refers to those physical device I need immediate access to to restore services and
cloud gateways. That is it. In practice, this is:
    - Routers
    - Switches
    - Physical Hypervisor Servers
    - Cloud Gateways.

I'll also add one rule: Address allocation in areas in the Management.Administrative network can only be allocate in /24 blocks, with at least a /20 in between each so that I never shoot myself in the foot. It is greedy, but I'm not curently running an enterprise. Ansd as I said before, I would judge
it as a success if there is ever sufficient need to update this scheme given the growth ceiling.

Now on to VLAN's. When in doubt KISS:

    999 = Management
    899 = Administrative
    
For these 2 VLAN's build down to 900 and 800 respectively. Pray to god if it ever becomes a problem.

Then:
    700-799 = Virtual VLAN's
    600-699 = Experimental VLAN's <!-- Was Lab VLANS -->
    500-599 = In lab network addresses
    400-499 = In lab Server Addresses
    0-399 = Clients

That should allow it to stay consistent I think. If it cause problems, It's a learning experience, this is officially where my experience hits a wall.
I will clarify that I am changing Lab to Experimental for clarity's sake.

Now on to:

The actual only thing left is assigning management IP's, but I wil solidify documentation structure first, because I already see taht as a blind spot

## Documentation Structure
-/docs
|
|---- Admin (These are things like naming conventions, ip ranges, etc. QoL stuff)
|
|---- Netowrk (Topology, client IP ranges, devices etc.)
|
|----- Hosting (VM's host's and related data)
|
|----- Software (Docs on used software, yes even teh ones I code, I don't get a pass because as I always say "I will be the idot tommorow")
|
|----- Security (Security, IAM, etc. ) * FOR THE LOVE OF GOD DON'T PUT SECRETS ON GITHUB YOU DODO BIRD *
|
|----- Miscellaneous (For all the things that you forgot you forgot).

## Assigning Managment IP's
*AND NOW WE DOCUMENT THE ASSIGNING OF THE IP's AND THE CREATION OF THE VLANS*

In reality it's really not all that interesting, but I will document it here anyway for the lol's. It will sadly exist only in docs because I have to 
plug in on a different machine and can't be bothered to deal with moving screenshosts without a file server. First let me do some doc admin work.

## End Day

I actualy didn't assign managment addresses =(. I got distracted by
documentation. So I will pick that up tommorow. Leaving doc open and ready.

Also, I changed some of the plans laid out and need to add the IP plan to the 
admin docs. I will add a scheduled task. See relevant directories to see 
changes.
