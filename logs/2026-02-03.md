## Assigning Mangement IP's

I have already started designating IP addresses in the docs, after I have
done the doc assignment for each device, I will proceed to IOS configuration.

Ok, some document fudging and we are ready for IOS config. Firstly, we owe
the router some reconfig. I have designated 172.30.0.0-172.31.255.255 for
P2P. I have also decided that the core switch should own local VLANS. These
decisions were made completely independently. Anyway, the router should
now connect to the core switch via 172.30.0.1/30.

Also will configure each switch for SSH, so that I can make use of the 
mangment addresses.

The router being DHCP without VLAN info is going to complicate things slightly
as it needs to have address info from the relay.

I have decided to make the default client vlan VLAN10 for now.

Need to rembember
 - SSH V 2
 -  crypto key generate
 - SVI's
 - vtp transparent
 - Make Sure that tunk is enabled
 - allow trunk
 - aaa new-model
 - aaa authentication login default local

That's most of what I need. If you dno't do this, and you don't have a 
TACAS+ server, you cannot ssh into a device.
 
Also, I am doing a workaround to deal with some aaa stuff that needs more 
research: I am using enable secret only as enable auth, which is defoinitely
insecure, but it works for now. Will need to be remediated before we open up
to WAN.


Tomorrow, I will setup DHCP pool and see if we can get the pc to pull an
IP address.
