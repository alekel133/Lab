## Notes
This is a work in progress, but also an integral part of the lab, both educationally and functionally. As such, there may be
large scale changes, if something looks odd, feels very mature, or just seems interesting, please feel free to look through the
commit tree and see how it has changed. I will try to keep issues and pull requests detailed so that there is a good history
for those using this as a learning tool.
